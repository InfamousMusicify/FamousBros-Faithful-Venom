# Version History and Notes:
~~~
Minecraft 1.16: 

     Realease Candidate 3: (Rc-3)
Removed extra font files to improve experience for users who do not mainly speak english in game.

     Release Candidate 2: (Rc-2) 
     (at this point the pack became to large, switched to dropbox for file hosting.)
Added Textures for 1.16.  Tweaked a few faithful textures more to my own liking(for faithfulness to OG textures.)
Added Proper 32x Banner Textures.  (TY to the faithful team for fixing those up!<3)
Removed a few older useless things.  Updated mobs and blocks of 1.16.
Tweaked: Nylium of both varieties, made it fit with the OG netherrack texture better.
Nether_gold_ore/Nether_quartz_ore, Tweaked to fit with OG Netherrack.
Nether_quartz_ore Restylized with new faithful style but OG netherrack Textures.
Known Vanilla Issue: Trident Occasionally looks like its ripping thru the fabric of space-time as it flys.
(Release candidate has been tested very little, please report any issues on github issue tracker! <3)

     Release Candidate 1: (Rc-1)
Essentially Rc-2 but with 1 extra file which probably doesn't do anythhing.
Contains a file that supposedly corrects the tridents twitchy behaviour, but this file may be outdated,
at any rate its available for download should you deem it to be less twitchy with this tweak.
