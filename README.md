# FamousBros-Faithful-Venom

Old School Faithful Style Textures, Antvenoms Color Grading, Skitscape's UI.  
(Skitscape UI, pre 1.13 Faithful block and item textures, a few alpha sounds, and 7 item textures for my Raijin and Mark/Recall Datapacks)  
(My added datapack Textures will not affect Vanilla textutres.)

# [Download Pack](https://github.com/InfamousMusicify/FamousBros-Faithful-Venom/blob/master/FB-FV%20Downloads.md)

I made this resource pack for myself as a Composite of the Textures/UI and some custom stuff for my datapacks.  
Released it publicly because I know I'm not the only one who doesnt like the new minecraft art style. (1.13 and later)  
And misses Antvenom's Faithful pack being updated more regularly.  
~~~
I likely wont update this very much.  
Mostly during new minecraft releases to catch up with textures.  or when I update my datapack textures.  
Please report any issues in the github issues section!  I will make an effort to fix any errors.  
Thank you for checking out the pack!

Disclaimer:
Faithful team does not allow there pack to be redistributed freely, I went and got permission from the team to create and share this pack with the public.  With the intent to share nostalgic textures/sounds with all.  I will take the pack down if the team requests it.
