# FamousBros-Faithful-Venom
Old School Faithful Textures, Antvenoms style of pack, with Custom textures for my datapacks.
(Skitscapes UI, mostly pre 1.13 Faithful Block and item textures, and textures for my Raijin and Mark/Recall Datapacks)

I made this resource pack for myself as a Composite of the Textures/UI and some custom stuff for my datapacks.
Released it publicly because I Know im not the only one who doesnt like the new faithful textures.
and misses antvenoms Faithful pack being updated regularly.

I likely wont update this very much.  Mostly during new minecraft releases to catch up with textures.  or when I update my datapack textures.

Thank you for checking out the pack!

Cheers
