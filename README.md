# FamousBros-Faithful-Venom

Old School Faithful Style Textures, Antvenoms Color Grading, Skitscape's UI.
(Skitscape UI, pre 1.14 Faithful block and item textures, a few alpha sounds, and 7 item textures for my Raijin and Mark/Recall Datapacks)  
(My added datapack Textures will not affect Vanilla textutres.)

Download/Install:  
~~~
Click "FB-FV Downloads.md" and then click the link to the version of the pack you wish to download.
Paste the Resource Pack into your .minecraft/resourcepacks folder.

I made this resource pack for myself as a Composite of the Textures/UI and some custom stuff for my datapacks.  
Released it publicly because I know I'm not the only one who doesnt like the new faithful textures.  
And misses Antvenom's Faithful pack being updated more regularly.  
~~~
I likely wont update this very much.  
Mostly during new minecraft releases to catch up with textures.  or when I update my datapack textures.  
Please report any issues in the github issues section!  I will make an effort to fix any errors.  
Thank you for checking out the pack!
