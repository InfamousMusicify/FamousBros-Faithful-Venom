                                        This is a 32x resource pack 
(Pre 1.13 Faithful textures, Skitscape UI, a few alpha sounds, and a few textures I tweaked for consistency)

__Updates usually occur slightly after new Minecraft releases.  
Please report any issues in the github issues section!  I will make an effort to fix any errors.  
Thank you for checking out the pack!__

Disclaimer:
Faithful team does not allow their pack to be redistributed freely,    
I went and got permission from the team to create and share this pack with the public.  
With the intent to share nostalgic textures/sounds with all.  
I will take the pack down if the team requests it.  
~~~

I made this pack for myself as a composite of the textures/UI and some custom textures.  
I dislike the new minecraft art style (I know I'm not alone there... 1.13 and later).  
And miss Antvenom's Faithful pack being updated more regularly.  
I am glad I can share this with you <3 I hope you enjoy!    

Cheers
