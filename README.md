~~~  
                                        This is a 32x resource pack    
(Dark / Skitscape UI, a few alpha sounds, and a few textures I tweaked for consistency with old mc art style)     
~~~

The original intent of this pack was to make an updated version of/tweak antvenoms faithful venom pack more to my liking, and for my server.       
It still accomplishes its goal, but you must download ant or mullaks pack now as well.  
I do not have time to check a whole pack for errors anymore. Or do more crediting than neccassary due to extra unneeded textures.            

When I originally obtained permission to use the faithful textures      
I was unaware of the debacle with Vattics work being stolen. (see deprecated branch for info)       

The folks who put together Antvenoms newest packs were gracious enough to include a license       
to use the textures for a project like this, so I did use a few and added credit and Vattic's license.     

This project is now a stripped down addon to Antvenom or mullak99's (or any vanilla 32x pack really) Resource packs.     
It adds Skits UI / Dark UI, Antvenoms grass color grading, select alpha sounds for nostalgia, custon nylium sides, and a few custom textures.

__Note:  
All Versions before and including `FB-FV_x32_1.18_R4` contain a full texture set and are not recomended due to copywrite/credit issues.      
I recomend that you use ant or mullak's packs alongside a newer version of FB-FV (Future releases will have identifiers in release notes.)      
Example: `FB-FV_1.19.2-r1`__        

__Credit: Vattic, mullak99, Antvenom, Skitscape       
They developed Many of the textures in this file.     
They do solid work and you should give them some love!__     

__Updates usually occur slightly after new Minecraft releases.      
Please report any issues in the github issues section!  I will make an effort to fix any errors.     
Thank you for checking out the pack!__     

I am glad I can share this with you <3 I hope you enjoy!       

Cheers
