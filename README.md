Old School Faithful Textures, Antvenoms Color Grading, Skitscape's UI, with Custom textures for my datapacks.
(Skitscape UI, pre 1.14 Faithful Block and Item textures, and textures for my Raijin and Mark/Recall Datapacks)
(My added datapack Textures will not affect Vanilla textutres.)

They developed 99.9% of the textures in this file.
They do Beutiful Work and you should give them some love!

I made this resource pack for myself as a Composite of the Textures/UI and some custom stuff for my datapacks.
Released it publicly because I know I'm not the only one who doesnt like the new faithful textures.
And misses Antvenom's Faithful pack being updated more regularly.

I likely wont update this very much.  
Mostly during new minecraft releases to catch up with textures.  or when I update my datapack textures.

Please report any issues in the github issues section!  I will make an effort to fix any errors.

Thank you for checking out the pack!
