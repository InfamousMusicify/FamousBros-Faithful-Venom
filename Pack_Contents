This only applies to the most recent release.

Q: What does the pack change?
A: It uses all the 1.12 Faithful textures, most of the newer 1.13-1.16+ Faithful block/item textures/ Dark UI,
Antvenoms swamp color grade/ old school sounds/ exp bar, Skitscapes UI.

I: There are a few Custom remade textures: nylium of both varieties, 
nether_gold_ore and nether_quartz_ore have all been customized to fit this packs asthetic.

I: As of 1.16 the pigman and a few minor textures have been swapped for 
more recent faithful textures for a more modern minecraft look/feel.
(Keeping faithful where it matters, updating new textures to fit the new Lore.)

Q: What is this pack?
A: As stated in the README.md, 
this pack is a compostie of features that I like from Faithful/ Antvenom/ Skitscape and a few of my own textures.

This Pack is essentially an updated Faithful Venom pack for Antvenom with a few less and a few more features.
(Antvenom recently updated his pack but it removes a few features I like.  So I created this.)
