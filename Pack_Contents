Q: What does the pack change?
A: It uses all the 1.14 Faithful textures, the newer 1.15 Faithful block/item textures/ Dark UI,
Antvenoms swamp color grade/ old school sounds/ exp bar, Skitscapes UI, and a few textures for custom datapacks I made.

I: There are a few missing textures in the banner textures as no one on the faithful team has updated them yet.
as well as a few of the sheild/banner textures.  (shields are fine but the applied banner textures arent yet updated)
I: There are also a few missing textures for the Netherrack as I couldnt figure out why they were breaking.
They do not effect the overall visuals tho, its just a directional texture thing, netherrack looks normal.
(they looked bad anyways so...)

Q: What is this pack?
A: As stated in the README.txt, 
this pack is a compostie of features that I like from Faithful/ Antvenom/ Skitscape and a few of my own textures.

This Pack is essentially an updated Faithful Venom pack for Antvenom with a few less and a few more features.
(Antvenom recently updated his pack but it removes a few features I like.  So I created this.)
