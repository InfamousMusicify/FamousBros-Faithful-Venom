Q: What is this pack?  
A: As stated in the README.md,   
This pack is a compostie of features that I like from Faithful/ Antvenom/ Skitscape and a few of my own textures.  

This Pack is essentially an Tweaked and stripped down Faithful Venom pack from Antvenom with some minor feature changes.   
(Antvenom recently updated his pack but it removes a few features I like.  So I use this on top of it.)   

Old things (May be removed later.):   
adds Dark UI.   

Old removed things:   
<s>
  I: As of 1.16 the pigman and a few minor textures have been swapped for   
more recent faithful textures for a more modern minecraft look/feel.  
(Keeping faithful where it matters, updating new textures to fit the new Lore.)
