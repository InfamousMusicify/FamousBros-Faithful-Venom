I: There are a few Custom remade textures: nylium of both varieties,   
nether_gold_ore and nether_quartz_ore have all been customized to fit this packs asthetic.  

Q: What is this pack?  
A: As stated in the README.md,   
This pack is a compostie of features that I like from Faithful/ Antvenom/ Skitscape and a few of my own textures.  

This Pack is essentially an Tweaked and stripped down Faithful Venom pack from Antvenom with some minor feature changes.   
(Antvenom recently updated his pack but it removes a few features I like.  So I use this on top of it.)   



Authors Note:   
The original intent of this pack was to make an updated version of/tweak antvenoms faithful venom pack more to my liking, and for my server.       
It still accomplishes its goal, but you must download ant or mullaks pack now as well.  
I do not have time to check a whole pack for errors anymore. Or do more crediting than neccassary due to extra unneeded textures.            

When I originally obtained permission to use the faithful textures      
I was unaware of the debacle with Vattics work being stolen. (see deprecated branch for info)       

The folks who put together Antvenoms newest packs were gracious enough to include a license       
to use the textures for a project like this, so I did use a few and added credit and Vattic's license.   

Old removed things:   
<s>
  I: As of 1.16 the pigman and a few minor textures have been swapped for   
more recent faithful textures for a more modern minecraft look/feel.  
(Keeping faithful where it matters, updating new textures to fit the new Lore.)
